# Cats and their properties

![image](/img/cats-screenshot.png)

This project was my first big project using Javascript and APIs.

## Description

_Cats and their properties_ is an informational site about cat breeds. The site content is fetched from The Cat API.
This project was an exercise in using APIs and their documentation in my Javascript Course Exam.
For some fun I dynamically converted the cats' ratings into emojis!

## Built With

- [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com)
- Javascript

## Future Plans

While this project works fine, I do have some ideas for changes I would like to make in the future.
